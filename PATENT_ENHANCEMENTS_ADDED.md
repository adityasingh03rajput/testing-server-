### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Infringement Protection Clause (LEGAL BOMB 💣)
**Location:** After Hardware Integration, before Claims

**The KILLER line:**
> "Any attempt to replicate, imitate, or circumvent this system's workflow, verification logic, presence validation method, or cascading propagation mechanism by altering the sequence, medium, signal, or threshold **SHALL STILL CONSTITUTE INFRINGEMENT** of this invention."

**Covers 10 modification attempts:**
1. Altering signal medium (light, radio, magnetic instead of ultrasonic)
2. Modifying verification sequence (changing order of checks)
3. Adjusting signal parameters (different frequencies/modulation)
4. Changing threshold values (different acceptance criteria)
5. Substituting verification factors (fingerprint instead of face)
6. Implementing alternative cascading (different relay logic)
7. Employing different anomaly detection (alternative scoring)
8. Utilizing varied hardware (different devices/platforms)
9. Applying to different domains (corporate, government, healthcare)
10. Combining with additional technologies (AI, blockchain, IoT)

**Core Protected Concept:**
- Identity verification (WHO)
- Location verification (WHERE)
- Proximity verification (NEAR WHOM)
- Temporal verification (WHEN)
- Cascading peer validation (CONFIRMED BY PEERS)

**Why this is a LEGAL LANDMINE:**
- Prevents "method modification" copying
- Covers ALL possible variations
- Protects the CONCEPT, not just implementation
- Makes it nearly impossible to design around
- Competitors can't just "change the frequency" and claim novelty
