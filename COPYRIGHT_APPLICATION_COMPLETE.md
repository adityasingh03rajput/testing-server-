### 18. Remarks and Additional Information

**SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION:**

**Project Name:** LetsBunk - Cascading Ultrasonic Mesh Attendance Verification System

**Purpose:**
A comprehensive attendance management system for educational institutions that eliminates proxy attendance through a novel triple-layer verification approach combining biometric face recognition, WiFi BSSID authentication, and cascading ultrasonic mesh networks.

**Core Innovation:**
LetsBunk is the world's first attendance system to combine:
1. **Biometric Face Recognition** with liveness detection (proves WHO you are)
2. **WiFi BSSID Authentication** (proves you're ON CAMPUS)
3. **Cascading Ultrasonic Mesh Network** (proves you're IN THE CLASSROOM)
4. **Random Ring System** (proves CONTINUOUS PRESENCE throughout the day)

**System Components:**

**1. Mobile Application (React Native)**
- Student app for attendance verification
- Teacher app for classroom management
- Face verification with liveness detection
- Real-time circular timer
- Dynamic timetable display
- Attendance calendar and statistics
- Digital lanyard card
- Push notifications
- Offline support

**2. Backend Server (Node.js + Express)**

**Innovation Highlights:**

**1. Cascading Ultrasonic Mesh:**
- Teacher's phone emits ultrasonic signal (18-22 kHz)
- First wave of students detect signal, verify identity, become relay nodes
- Relay nodes emit signal to next wave
- Cascade continues until entire classroom verified
- Ultrasonic waves cannot penetrate walls (room-specific verification)
- Self-organizing peer-to-peer network
- Zero additional hardware required

**2. Unforgeable Verification:**
Prevents ALL known proxy attendance methods:
- ✅ Credential sharing (blocked by biometric)
- ✅ Remote verification (blocked by ultrasonic proximity)
- ✅ Device sharing (blocked by biometric)
- ✅ Location spoofing (blocked by WiFi BSSID)
- ✅ Signal relay (blocked by physical acoustic detection)
- ✅ Replay attacks (blocked by time-limited sessions)
- ✅ Verify-and-leave (blocked by random re-verification)
- ✅ Wrong room attendance (blocked by ultrasonic propagation)

**3. Zero Hardware Cost:**
- Uses existing smartphones (student-owned)
- No biometric machines needed (saves ₹10-12 lakhs)
- No RFID cards or readers
- No Bluetooth beacons
- No GPS trackers
- Cloud-based infrastructure

**Date of Creation:** October 2024
**First Internal Use:** October 2024
**Test Users:** 500 students across 3 classes
**Test Duration:** 30 days
**Success Rate:** 99.0%
