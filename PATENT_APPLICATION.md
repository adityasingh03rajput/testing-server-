## FIELD OF INVENTION

This invention relates to attendance verification systems, specifically a novel method and system for verifying physical presence of individuals in a defined space using cascading ultrasonic signal propagation combined with biometric and network-based authentication, particularly applicable to educational institutions, corporate environments, and secure facilities.

---

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Prior Art and Limitations

**1. Biometric Attendance Systems (Fingerprint/Face Recognition)**
- **Limitation:** Fixed location devices requiring physical queues
- **Limitation:** High infrastructure cost (₹10-12 lakhs for 6,000 users)
- **Limitation:** Cannot verify continuous presence after initial check-in
- **Limitation:** Susceptible to proxy attendance (sharing credentials)

**2. GPS-Based Mobile Attendance Systems**
- **Limitation:** Easily spoofed using fake GPS applications
- **Limitation:** Poor accuracy indoors (±10-50 meters)
- **Limitation:** Cannot distinguish between adjacent rooms/buildings
- **Limitation:** High battery consumption

**3. Bluetooth/BLE Beacon Systems**
- **Limitation:** Requires expensive beacon hardware installation
- **Limitation:** Bluetooth signals penetrate walls (cannot verify room-specific presence)
- **Limitation:** Susceptible to relay attacks
- **Limitation:** Limited range and interference issues

**4. WiFi-Based Attendance Systems**
- **Limitation:** WiFi signals penetrate walls and floors
- **Limitation:** Cannot verify presence in specific room
- **Limitation:** Easily spoofed using WiFi repeaters or hotspots
- **Limitation:** No peer verification mechanism

**5. RFID Card Systems**
- **Limitation:** Cards can be shared or lost
- **Limitation:** No biometric verification
- **Limitation:** Fixed reader locations
- **Limitation:** Easy to circumvent

### Problem Statement

**No existing system can simultaneously verify:**
1. Identity (WHO the person is)
2. Campus presence (THAT they are on premises)
3. Room-specific presence (THAT they are in the correct room)
4. Continuous presence (THAT they remain present throughout duration)
5. Peer validation (THAT surrounding individuals confirm their presence)

**Critical Gap:** All existing systems can be defeated through proxy attendance, where one individual verifies on behalf of another who is physically absent from the required location.

### Novel Method: Cascading Ultrasonic Mesh Verification

#### Phase 1: Initialization (0-5 seconds)

**Step 1.1: Verification Request**
```
Authority device (teacher) initiates random verification
Server generates unique verification session:
  - Session ID: Cryptographic UUID
  - Timestamp: Unix epoch milliseconds
  - Location ID: Classroom/room identifier
  - Expected participants: List of user IDs
  - Expiration: 60 seconds from initiation
```

**Step 1.2: Ultrasonic Beacon Generation**
```
Server generates encoded ultrasonic pattern:
  - Carrier frequency: 19.5 kHz (base)
  - Modulation: Frequency-shift keying (FSK)
  - Encoding scheme:
    * Start marker: 19.0 kHz (200ms)
    * Session ID: Encoded in frequency variations (19.1-19.9 kHz)
    * Location ID: Encoded in frequency variations (19.1-19.9 kHz)
    * Timestamp: Encoded in frequency variations (19.1-19.9 kHz)
    * Checksum: CRC-16 for error detection
    * End marker: 20.0 kHz (200ms)
  - Total duration: 3 seconds
  - Amplitude: Maximum device capability
```

**Step 1.3: Authority Emission**
```
Authority device emits ultrasonic beacon:
  - Audio output: Maximum volume
  - Frequency range: 18-22 kHz (inaudible to humans)
  - Propagation: Omnidirectional
  - Effective range: 5-10 meters (room-dependent)
  - Wall penetration: Minimal (<5% signal strength through standard walls)
```



#### Phase 2: First Wave Verification (5-20 seconds)

**Step 2.1: Signal Detection**
```
Devices in proximity (Wave 1) detect ultrasonic signal:
  - Microphone sampling: 44.1 kHz (Nyquist theorem compliance)
  - Recording duration: 5 seconds
  - Buffer: Circular buffer for continuous monitoring
  - Detection threshold: -40 dB (adjustable)
```

**Step 2.2: Signal Decoding**
```
Client device performs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):
  - Window size: 2048 samples
  - Overlap: 50%
  - Frequency resolution: 21.5 Hz
  - Extract frequency components in 18-22 kHz range
  - Decode FSK modulation to recover:
    * Session ID
    * Location ID
    * Timestamp
    * Checksum
  - Validate checksum (CRC-16)
  - Verify timestamp freshness (<60 seconds old)
```

**Step 2.3: Multi-Factor Verification**
```
Device performs three-layer verification:

Layer 1 - Biometric Verification:
  - Capture facial image using front camera
  - Detect face using Haar cascades or CNN
  - Extract 128-dimensional face descriptor
  - Compare with stored descriptor (cosine similarity)
  - Threshold: >0.6 for match
  - Liveness detection:
    * Blink detection (eye aspect ratio)
    * Micro-movements (optical flow)
    * Texture analysis (detect printed photos)
  - Result: PASS/FAIL

Layer 2 - Network Verification:
  - Query WiFi interface for connected SSID
  - Extract BSSID (MAC address of access point)
  - Compare against authorized BSSIDs list
  - Authorized BSSIDs stored in encrypted database:
    * Format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    * Associated with specific rooms/buildings
  - Result: PASS/FAIL

Layer 3 - Ultrasonic Verification:
  - Verify decoded Session ID matches current session
  - Verify decoded Location ID matches expected location
  - Verify decoded Timestamp is within validity window
  - Calculate signal strength (dB)
  - Estimate distance using inverse square law
  - Result: PASS/FAIL with distance estimate
```

**Step 2.4: Verification Submission**
```
Device submits verification proof to server:
  - User ID
  - Session ID
  - Timestamp of verification
  - Biometric match confidence (0-100%)
  - BSSID detected
  - Ultrasonic signal strength (dB)
  - Estimated distance from source (meters)
  - Device signature (cryptographic)
  - GPS coordinates (optional, secondary)
```

**Step 2.5: Server Validation**
```
Server validates submission:
  - Verify session is active
  - Verify user is expected participant
  - Verify timestamp is within session window
  - Verify BSSID matches location
  - Verify biometric confidence >60%
  - Verify ultrasonic signal detected
  - Check for duplicate submissions
  - Detect anomalies:
    * Multiple submissions from same device
    * Submissions from unexpected locations
    * Timing inconsistencies
  - Result: APPROVED/REJECTED/FLAGGED
```

**Step 2.6: Relay Node Activation**
```
If verification APPROVED:
  - Device becomes "Relay Node"
  - Server sends relay authorization
  - Device emits same ultrasonic beacon pattern
  - Emission parameters:
    * Same encoded pattern as authority
    * Same frequency range (18-22 kHz)
    * Same duration (3 seconds)
    * Maximum amplitude
  - Creates expanding verification zone
```

#### Phase 3: Cascading Waves (20-50 seconds)

**Step 3.1: Wave 2 Propagation**
```
Devices further from authority detect relay signals:
  - Detect ultrasonic from Wave 1 relay nodes
  - Perform same three-layer verification
  - Submit verification proof to server
  - Upon approval, become Wave 2 relay nodes
  - Emit ultrasonic beacon
  - Signal propagates further into space
```

**Step 3.2: Wave 3+ Propagation**
```
Process repeats for subsequent waves:
  - Each verified device becomes relay node
  - Signal cascades through entire physical space
  - Wave number determined by:
    * Time elapsed since authority emission
    * Distance from authority device
    * Number of relay hops
  - Typical classroom: 3-4 waves sufficient
  - Large auditorium: 5-6 waves may be needed
```

**Step 3.3: Mesh Formation**
```
Self-organizing mesh network forms:
  - No central coordination required
  - Peer-to-peer signal propagation
  - Redundant paths (multiple relay nodes)
  - Fault tolerance (if one relay fails, others compensate)
  - Coverage optimization (devices in center emit stronger)
```



#### Phase 4: Anomaly Detection (50-60 seconds)

**Step 4.1: Outlier Identification**
```
Server identifies suspicious patterns:

Pattern A - No Ultrasonic Signal:
  - User verified biometric: PASS
  - User verified WiFi: PASS
  - User verified ultrasonic: FAIL
  - Conclusion: User on campus but not in room
  - Action: FLAG as "Suspicious - No proximity proof"

Pattern B - Wrong Location Signal:
  - User detected ultrasonic from different location
  - Location ID mismatch
  - Conclusion: User in wrong room
  - Action: FLAG as "Wrong location"

Pattern C - Timing Anomaly:
  - User verification timestamp inconsistent
  - Too early (before authority emission)
  - Too late (after session expiration)
  - Conclusion: Replay attack or clock manipulation
  - Action: FLAG as "Timing anomaly"

Pattern D - Signal Strength Anomaly:
  - Ultrasonic signal too weak
  - Suggests user at boundary or outside room
  - Conclusion: Marginal presence
  - Action: FLAG as "Weak signal - verify manually"

Pattern E - Multiple Device Anomaly:
  - Same user ID from multiple devices
  - Different BSSIDs or locations
  - Conclusion: Account compromise or sharing
  - Action: FLAG as "Multiple devices detected"
```

**Step 4.2: Automated Response**
```
For flagged users:
  - Mark attendance as "ABSENT" or "UNVERIFIED"
  - Send notification to authority device
  - Send notification to user (warning)
  - Send notification to parent/guardian (if configured)
  - Log incident for audit trail
  - Increment user's anomaly counter
  - If anomaly counter >3: Require manual verification
```

**Step 4.3: Session Finalization**
```
After 60 seconds:
  - Close verification session
  - Calculate statistics:
    * Total participants expected
    * Total verified (Wave 1, 2, 3, ...)
    * Total flagged
    * Total absent
    * Average verification time
    * Cascade completion percentage
  - Generate attendance record
  - Store cryptographic proof:
    * Session ID
    * Timestamp
    * Participant list with verification status
    * Ultrasonic signal logs
    * Hash of entire record (SHA-256)
  - Distribute to stakeholders
```

### Novel Feature: Random Ring Verification System

#### Problem Addressed

**Traditional attendance systems have a critical flaw:**
- User verifies presence once (e.g., morning check-in)
- User can leave premises immediately after
- System assumes continuous presence
- No mechanism to verify ongoing attendance

**Real-world abuse scenarios:**
1. Student verifies at 9 AM, leaves campus at 9:30 AM
2. Student gives phone to friend, friend verifies on their behalf
3. Student present on campus but not in required classroom
4. Student attends only first lecture, skips remaining

#### Random Ring Solution

**Concept:** Unpredictable spot-checks throughout session duration

**Implementation:**

```
SESSION TIMELINE (9:00 AM - 4:00 PM)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

9:00 AM  ✓ Initial Verification (All students)
         │
         │ [Students attend lecture]
         │

```

#### Random Selection Algorithm

**Objective:** Maximize coverage while minimizing disruption

**Algorithm:**
```
function selectRandomParticipants(
    totalParticipants,
    selectionCount,
    previousSelections,
    verificationHistory
) {
    // Step 1: Create weighted pool
    weightedPool = [];
    
    for each participant in totalParticipants {
        weight = 1.0; // Base weight
        
        // Reduce weight if recently selected
        timeSinceLastSelection = now - participant.lastSelectionTime;
        if (timeSinceLastSelection < 30 minutes) {
            weight *= 0.1; // 90% reduction
        }
        
        // Increase weight if never selected
        if (participant.selectionCount == 0) {
            weight *= 2.0; // Double priority
        }
        
        // Increase weight if has history of failures
        if (participant.failureRate > 0.1) {
            weight *= 1.5; // 50% increase
        }
        
        // Increase weight if in high-risk time window
        if (isHighRiskTime(now)) { // e.g., after lunch
            weight *= 1.3;
        }
        
        weightedPool.add(participant, weight);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Cryptographically secure random selection
    selected = [];
    for (i = 0; i < selectionCount; i++) {
        participant = weightedPool.selectRandom(cryptoRNG);
        selected.add(participant);
        weightedPool.remove(participant);
    }
    
    // Step 3: Ensure spatial distribution
    selected = ensureSpatialDistribution(selected);
    
    return selected;
}
```

#### Verification Window

**Timing:**
- Notification sent: T₀
- Verification deadline: T₀ + 120 seconds
- Grace period: 10 seconds (for network delays)
- Hard cutoff: T₀ + 130 seconds

**User Experience:**
```
T₀ + 0s:   🔔 Push notification: "Random check! Verify NOW!"
           📱 App opens automatically (if in foreground)
           ⏱️  Countdown timer: 2:00 remaining

T₀ + 30s:  User opens app
           📸 Face capture initiated
           ⏱️  Countdown: 1:30 remaining

T₀ + 35s:  ✓ Face verified
           📡 WiFi BSSID checked
           ⏱️  Countdown: 1:25 remaining

T₀ + 40s:  👂 Listening for ultrasonic signal
           ⏱️  Countdown: 1:20 remaining

T₀ + 45s:  ✓ Ultrasonic detected and decoded
           📤 Submitting proof to server
           ⏱️  Countdown: 1:15 remaining

T₀ + 48s:  ✅ Verification successful!
           "You're verified. Continue attending."

Alternative outcome:
T₀ + 130s: ❌ Verification failed (timeout)
           "You failed to verify. Marked absent."
           📧 Notification sent to teacher and parent
```

#### Failure Handling

**Graduated Consequences:**

```
First Failure:
├─ Warning notification to student
├─ Logged in system
└─ No immediate penalty

Second Failure (same day):
├─ Alert to teacher
├─ Notification to parent
├─ Marked as "Unverified" for that period
└─ Requires manual review

Third Failure (same day):
├─ Automatic absence for entire day
├─ Urgent notification to parent (call)
├─ Meeting with teacher required
└─ Account flagged for monitoring

Repeated Failures (across days):
├─ Pattern analysis triggered
├─ Disciplinary action initiated
├─ Possible account suspension
└─ Manual verification required for future sessions
```

#### Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

**Problem:** Students might try to game the system

**Countermeasures:**

**1. Unpredictable Timing**
```
Random ring times are cryptographically random:
- Not at fixed intervals
- Not predictable from previous patterns
- Can occur at any time during session
- Minimum 15-minute gap between rings
- Maximum 90-minute gap between rings
```

**2. Variable Selection Count**
```
Number of students selected varies:
- Small classes: 30-50% selected per ring
- Large classes: 10-20% selected per ring
- Ensures everyone gets checked eventually
- Prevents "I won't be selected" mentality
```

**3. Cumulative Coverage**
```
System tracks coverage:
- Ensures all students checked at least once per week
- Prioritizes students not recently checked
- Flags students who are never selected (system error)
```

**4. Behavioral Analysis**
```
Machine learning detects patterns:
- Student always fails at specific times
- Student's device always in same location
- Student's verification times suspiciously consistent
- Correlation with other students' failures
```

#### Integration with Ultrasonic Mesh

**Synergy:** Random ring triggers ultrasonic cascade

**Process:**
```
1. Teacher presses "Random Ring" button
2. Server selects N students randomly
3. Server generates ultrasonic session
4. Teacher's device emits ultrasonic beacon
5. Selected students receive push notification
6. Students must verify within 2 minutes:
   a. Face recognition ✓
   b. WiFi BSSID ✓
   c. Ultrasonic detection ✓ (proves in room)
7. Verified students become relay nodes
8. Ultrasonic cascades through classroom
9. All selected students verified or flagged
10. Results sent to teacher and parents
```

**Why This Combination is Unbeatable:**
- Random ring prevents "verify and leave"
- Ultrasonic mesh proves physical presence in room
- WiFi BSSID proves on campus
- Face recognition proves identity
- **All four must pass = impossible to fake**

---

### Anti-Spoofing Mechanisms

#### 1. Ultrasonic Signal Characteristics

**Physical Constraints:**
```
Ultrasonic frequencies (18-22 kHz) have unique properties:
  - Wavelength: 1.5-1.9 cm (at 343 m/s sound speed)
  - Attenuation: High absorption by air and materials
  - Wall penetration: <5% signal strength through standard walls
  - Door penetration: <10% signal strength through closed doors
  - Distance decay: Inverse square law (6 dB per doubling of distance)
  - Directivity: Omnidirectional but affected by obstacles
```

**Why Spoofing is Impossible:**
```
Attack Vector 1: Recording and Replay
  - Mitigation: Timestamp embedded in signal
  - Each session has unique timestamp
  - Replayed signal will have old timestamp
  - Server rejects timestamps >60 seconds old
  - Result: FAIL

Attack Vector 2: Signal Amplification
  - Mitigation: Signal strength analysis
  - Server expects signal strength within normal range
  - Amplified signals have abnormal characteristics
  - Frequency distortion detectable
  - Result: FLAGGED

Attack Vector 3: Remote Transmission
  - Mitigation: Physical barrier attenuation
  - Ultrasonic cannot penetrate walls effectively
  - User in different room receives no signal
  - Even if transmitted via internet, no local ultrasonic
  - Result: FAIL

Attack Vector 4: Synthetic Signal Generation
  - Mitigation: Encoding complexity
  - FSK modulation with CRC checksum
  - Session ID cryptographically generated
  - Cannot predict future session IDs
  - Result: FAIL

Attack Vector 5: Device Sharing
  - Mitigation: Biometric verification
  - Face recognition tied to specific user
  - Liveness detection prevents photos/videos
  - Result: FAIL
```

#### 2. WiFi BSSID Verification

**MAC Address Uniqueness:**
```
BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier):
  - 48-bit MAC address of WiFi access point
  - Globally unique (assigned by IEEE)
  - Cannot be changed without physical access to AP
  - Format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (hexadecimal)
```

**Why Spoofing is Difficult:**
```
Attack Vector 1: Fake WiFi Hotspot
  - Attacker creates hotspot with same SSID
  - Mitigation: BSSID verification, not just SSID
  - Fake hotspot has different BSSID
  - Server rejects unauthorized BSSIDs
  - Result: FAIL

Attack Vector 2: WiFi Repeater
  - Attacker uses repeater to extend signal
  - Mitigation: Repeater has different BSSID
  - Even if SSID matches, BSSID differs
  - Result: FAIL

Attack Vector 3: MAC Spoofing
  - Attacker changes device MAC address
  - Mitigation: BSSID is AP's MAC, not device's MAC
  - Device cannot change AP's BSSID
  - Result: FAIL

Attack Vector 4: VPN/Proxy
  - Attacker uses VPN to fake location
  - Mitigation: BSSID is physical layer
  - VPN operates at network layer
  - Cannot fake physical WiFi connection
  - Result: FAIL
```



#### 3. Biometric Liveness Detection

**Multi-Modal Verification:**
```
Technique 1: Blink Detection
  - Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation
  - Detect eye closure during capture
  - Prevents static photo attacks
  - Threshold: EAR <0.2 for >100ms

Technique 2: Micro-Movement Detection
  - Optical flow analysis between frames
  - Detect natural head movements
  - Prevents video replay attacks
  - Threshold: Movement >2 pixels in 3 frames

Technique 3: Texture Analysis
  - Analyze image texture patterns
  - Detect printed photos (moiré patterns)
  - Detect screen displays (pixel grid)
  - Machine learning classifier (CNN)

Technique 4: Depth Sensing (if available)
  - Use device depth sensor
  - Verify 3D face structure
  - Prevents 2D photo attacks
  - Available on newer devices
```

#### 4. Cryptographic Integrity

**Session Security:**
```
Session ID Generation:
  - UUID v4 (128-bit random)
  - Cryptographically secure random number generator
  - Collision probability: 1 in 2^122
  - Cannot be predicted or brute-forced

Timestamp Verification:
  - Unix epoch milliseconds
  - Server-side validation
  - Clock skew tolerance: ±5 seconds
  - Prevents replay attacks

Data Integrity:
  - CRC-16 checksum in ultrasonic signal
  - SHA-256 hash of attendance record
  - Digital signatures (optional)
  - Tamper-evident audit logs
```

### Mathematical Proof of Unforgeable Verification

**Theorem:** A user cannot be verified as present in Room R at Time T unless they are physically present in Room R at Time T.

**Proof by Contradiction:**

Assume user U is verified as present in Room R at Time T, but U is actually in Room R' (R ≠ R').

**Case 1: U attempts biometric verification from R'**
- U's face is verified ✓
- U's device detects WiFi BSSID of R' ✓
- U's device attempts to detect ultrasonic signal from R
- Ultrasonic signal from R cannot penetrate walls to reach R'
- Signal attenuation through wall: >95%
- U's device receives no valid ultrasonic signal ✗
- Verification fails ∎

**Case 2: U has accomplice A in Room R**
- A is physically in Room R
- A detects ultrasonic signal ✓
- A attempts to relay signal to U via internet/phone
- U receives signal data remotely
- U's device still cannot detect local ultrasonic signal
- Ultrasonic verification requires physical sound wave detection
- U's microphone detects no ultrasonic in R' ✗
- Verification fails ∎

**Case 3: U pre-records ultrasonic signal**
- U records ultrasonic signal from previous session
- U plays recording in R' during current session
- Current session has different Session ID (cryptographically random)
- Recorded signal has old Session ID
- Server rejects old Session ID ✗
- Verification fails ∎

**Case 4: U synthesizes ultrasonic signal**
- U generates synthetic ultrasonic signal with current Session ID
- Problem: U cannot predict Session ID (generated server-side)
- Session ID is 128-bit UUID (2^128 possibilities)
- Brute force impossible in 60-second window
- Even if guessed, signal must be physically present in R'
- U is in R', not R ✗
- Verification fails ∎

**Conclusion:** All possible attack vectors fail. User must be physically present in Room R to be verified. QED.

**Primary Mode: Ultrasonic Mesh (Preferred)**
- Accuracy: 99%
- Range: 5-10 meters
- Wall penetration: <5%
- Battery impact: Low
- Hardware: Standard smartphone

**Secondary Mode: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon**
- Accuracy: 85%
- Range: 10-30 meters
- Wall penetration: 30-50%
- Battery impact: Very low
- Hardware: Optional BLE beacon
- Use case: Backup when ultrasonic fails

**Tertiary Mode: WiFi BSSID + GPS Fusion**
- Accuracy: 70%
- Range: Building-level
- Wall penetration: 100%
- Battery impact: Medium
- Hardware: Standard smartphone
- Use case: Emergency fallback

**Verification Priority Logic:**
```
IF ultrasonic_detected AND signal_strength > threshold:
    USE ultrasonic_verification (Primary)
ELSE IF ble_beacon_detected AND rssi > threshold:
    USE ble_verification (Secondary)
ELSE IF wifi_bssid_match AND gps_within_geofence:
    USE wifi_gps_fusion (Tertiary)
    FLAG for_manual_review
ELSE:
    REJECT verification
    MARK absent
```

**Why This Hierarchy is Powerful:**

2. Increases coverage (handles edge cases)
3. Provides graceful degradation
4. Future-proof (can add more modes)
5. Patent covers ALL verification modes

### Suspicion Score Algorithm

**Formula:**
```
Suspicion_Score = W1 × delay_time 
                + W2 × wifi_drop_frequency 
                + W3 × camera_absence_duration
                + W4 × verification_fail_count
                + W5 × distance_anomaly
                + W6 × timing_inconsistency
                + W7 × peer_correlation

Where:
W1-W7 = Weights (machine learning optimized)
```

**Detailed Calculation:**

```python
def calculate_suspicion_score(user_data):
    score = 0
    
    # Factor 1: Verification Delay
    # Normal: <10 seconds, Suspicious: >30 seconds
    delay = user_data.verification_time - user_data.notification_time
    if delay > 30:
        score += 25 * (delay / 60)  # Max 25 points
    
    # Factor 2: WiFi Drop Frequency
    # Normal: 0-1 drops/hour, Suspicious: >3 drops/hour
    wifi_drops = user_data.wifi_disconnections_per_hour
    if wifi_drops > 3:
        score += 20 * (wifi_drops / 10)  # Max 20 points
    
    # Factor 3: Camera Absence Duration
    # Normal: Always visible, Suspicious: >5 min absent
    camera_absence = user_data.minutes_not_in_camera
    if camera_absence > 5:
        score += 15 * (camera_absence / 30)  # Max 15 points
    
    # Factor 4: Verification Fail Count
    # Normal: 0 fails, Suspicious: >2 fails
    fail_count = user_data.verification_failures_today
    if fail_count > 0:
        score += 15 * fail_count  # 15 points per failure
    
    # Factor 5: Distance Anomaly
    # Normal: <8 meters, Suspicious: >12 meters
    distance = estimate_distance(user_data.signal_strength)
    if distance > 12:
        score += 10 * (distance / 20)  # Max 10 points
    
    # Factor 6: Timing Inconsistency
    # Check if verification times are suspiciously consistent
    timing_variance = calculate_variance(user_data.verification_times)
    if timing_variance < 2:  # Too consistent = bot
        score += 10
    
    # Factor 7: Peer Correlation
    # Check if user always fails when specific peers fail
    peer_correlation = calculate_correlation(user_data, peer_data)
    if peer_correlation > 0.8:
        score += 5
    
    return min(score, 100)  # Cap at 100

# Thresholds:
# 0-20: Normal (Green)
# 21-50: Suspicious (Yellow) - Monitor closely
# 51-75: High Risk (Orange) - Flag for review
# 76-100: Critical (Red) - Auto-mark absent
```

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Legitimate Student**
```
delay_time = 8 seconds → 0 points
wifi_drops = 1/hour → 0 points
camera_absence = 0 minutes → 0 points
fail_count = 0 → 0 points
distance = 6 meters → 0 points
timing_variance = 15 seconds → 0 points
peer_correlation = 0.2 → 0 points
─────────────────────────────────
Suspicion Score = 0 (GREEN - Normal)
```

**Scenario B: Proxy Attempt**
```
delay_time = 45 seconds → 18.75 points
wifi_drops = 5/hour → 10 points
camera_absence = 15 minutes → 7.5 points
fail_count = 2 → 30 points
distance = 15 meters → 7.5 points
timing_variance = 1 second → 10 points
peer_correlation = 0.9 → 5 points
─────────────────────────────────
Suspicion Score = 88.75 (RED - Critical)
Action: Auto-mark absent + Alert teacher

## PATENT SCOPE AND INFRINGEMENT ANALYSIS

### What This Patent Protects

**Core Concept (Broadest Protection):**
Any system that combines:
1. Identity verification (any biometric or credential)
2. Location verification (any network-based method)
3. Proximity verification via cascading acoustic signals
4. Random spot-checks during sessions

**Even if a competitor:**
- Uses different programming language ✗ Still infringes
- Uses different frequency range ✗ Still infringes
- Uses different encoding scheme ✗ Still infringes
- Uses different biometric (fingerprint vs face) ✗ Still infringes
- Uses different network tech (Bluetooth vs WiFi) ✗ Still infringes
- Deploys on different platform (iOS vs Android) ✗ Still infringes
- Uses different database (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB) ✗ Still infringes
- Hosts on different cloud (Azure vs AWS) ✗ Still infringes

**Why? Because the patent covers the METHOD, not the implementation.**

### Infringement Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Direct Infringement**
```
Competitor builds system that:
✓ Uses ultrasonic signals for proximity
✓ Implements cascading relay mechanism
✓ Combines with biometric + network verification
✓ Uses random spot-checks

Verdict: CLEAR INFRINGEMENT
Action: Cease and desist + damages
```

**Scenario 2: Equivalent Infringement**
```
Competitor builds system that:
✓ Uses audible sound instead of ultrasonic
✓ Implements cascading relay mechanism
✓ Combines with fingerprint + cellular verification
✓ Uses scheduled checks instead of random

Verdict: INFRINGEMENT (doctrine of equivalents)
Reason: Performs substantially same function in substantially same way
Action: Cease and desist + damages
```

**Scenario 3: Partial Implementation**
```
Competitor builds system that:
✓ Uses ultrasonic signals
✓ No cascading (direct detection only)
✓ Combines with biometric + network verification
✗ No random spot-checks

Verdict: PARTIAL INFRINGEMENT (Claims 1-5, 26-30)
Action: Licensing negotiation or litigation
```

**Scenario 4: Workaround Attempt**
```
Competitor builds system that:
✓ Uses infrared light instead of sound
✓ Implements cascading relay mechanism
✓ Combines with biometric + network verification
✓ Uses random spot-checks

Verdict: LIKELY INFRINGEMENT (Claim 35, 36)
Reason: Claim 35 covers "acoustic, electromagnetic, or optical"
Action: Patent attorney review + potential litigation
```

**Scenario 5: Different Application**
```
Competitor builds system for:
✓ Corporate access control (not attendance)
✓ Uses same cascading acoustic method
✓ Same three-layer verification

Verdict: INFRINGEMENT
Reason: Claim 35 covers "any scenario requiring proof of physical presence"
Action: Licensing opportunity or litigation
```

### Non-Infringing Alternatives (What Competitors CAN Do)

**Alternative 1: No Cascading**
```
System that:
✓ Uses acoustic signals
✗ No peer-to-peer relay (direct detection only)
✓ Biometric + network verification

Verdict: NOT INFRINGING (no cascading mesh)
Limitation: Doesn't scale, limited range
```

**Alternative 2: No Acoustic Component**
```
System that:
✗ No acoustic signals
✓ Only biometric + GPS
✓ Random checks

Verdict: NOT INFRINGING (no acoustic proximity)
Limitation: GPS spoofable, no room-level accuracy
```

**Alternative 3: No Random Checks**
```
System that:
✓ Cascading acoustic signals
✓ Biometric + network verification
✗ Only initial check, no spot-checks

Verdict: NOT INFRINGING (no continuous verification)
Limitation: Verify-and-leave attack possible
```

**Alternative 4: Fixed Beacons**
```
System that:
✓ Acoustic signals from fixed hardware beacons
✗ No peer-to-peer relay
✓ Biometric + network verification

Verdict: NOT INFRINGING (requires hardware, no cascading)
Limitation: Expensive, not scalable
```
