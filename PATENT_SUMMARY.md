## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING YOUR PATENT

### What Patent Protects:
✅ The METHOD of cascading ultrasonic verification
✅ The SYSTEM architecture
✅ The COMBINATION of three verification layers
✅ The CONCEPT of random spot-checks
✅ The IDEA of peer-to-peer relay mesh

### What Patent Does NOT Protect:
❌ The actual source code (use copyright)
❌ The brand name "LetsBunk" (use trademark)
❌ Specific algorithms (use trade secrets)
❌ UI/UX design (use design patent/copyright)
❌ Database structure (use trade secrets)

### How to Maximize Protection:
1. **Patent:** File for method/system
2. **Copyright:** Register source code
3. **Trademark:** Register brand name
4. **Trade Secrets:** Keep algorithms confidential
5. **Design Patent:** Register UI/UX (optional)
