## SECTION 5: ABSTRACT (Maximum 150 words)

A novel method and system for verifying physical presence using cascading ultrasonic mesh networks with random verification. The invention combines: (1) biometric identity verification with liveness detection, (2) WiFi BSSID authentication, (3) ultrasonic proximity verification via peer-to-peer signal propagation, and (4) unpredictable random spot-checks. An authority device emits encoded ultrasonic signals (18-22 kHz). Verified devices become relay nodes, creating self-organizing cascading waves. Ultrasonic frequencies cannot penetrate walls, ensuring room-specific verification. Random ring system selects subset of participants at unpredictable intervals, requiring immediate re-verification within time window. Optional camera-based continuous monitoring provides additional validation. System eliminates all proxy attendance methods by requiring simultaneous proof of identity, campus presence, room-specific co-location, and continuous presence. Zero additional hardware required. Applicable to educational institutions, corporate environments, and secure facilities.

## SECTION 22: NOVELTY STATEMENT

### 22.1 What is Novel?

**No prior art combines:**
1. Biometric verification with liveness detection
2. WiFi BSSID authentication for location
3. Ultrasonic signal propagation (18-22 kHz)
4. Cascading relay mesh network
5. Peer-to-peer validation mechanism
6. Random spot-check verification
7. Zero additional hardware requirement
8. Room-level granularity enforcement

### 22.2 Prior Art Differentiation

**vs Biometric Systems:** Adds ultrasonic proximity + random checks
**vs GPS Systems:** Adds ultrasonic mesh + room-level accuracy
**vs Bluetooth Beacons:** No hardware + cascading mesh + wall barrier
**vs RFID Systems:** Adds biometric + ultrasonic + continuous verification
**vs WiFi Tracking:** Adds ultrasonic layer + peer validation

### 22.3 Inventive Step (Non-Obviousness)

The combination of three independent verification layers with cascading acoustic mesh is:
- Not obvious to person skilled in the art
- Solves problem (proxy attendance) that prior art cannot solve
- Provides unexpected technical effect (unforgeable presence proof)
- Requires specific technical implementation (ultrasonic encoding, relay authorization)
